description: This dataset is composed of electrophysiology data from a tetraplegic
  human participant implanted with two 48 channel Utah arrays (Blackrock) in S1 area
  1 in the arm topographic region. The dataset includes preprocessed firing rate data
  for 96 recorded channels, and preprocessed linear decoding, RSA, and channel tuning
  analyses as described in Rosenthal et al, "S1 represents multisensory contexts and
  somatotopic locations within and outside the bounds of the cortical homunculus,"
  currently a preprint on bioArxiv.
